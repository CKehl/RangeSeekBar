# RangeSeekBar

This is an initial version of a View for Android that tries to mimic the behavior of the JQueryUI Slider widget.

## Usage
To include this library in your project please refer to Lars Vogel's tutorial on how to use Android libraries with Eclipse:
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidLibraryProjects/article.html

Lars explain things better than I ever could. You can include RangeSeekBar as a library source (import it as an Android Library in Eclipse) or you can use it as a .jar library (include by copying one of the release tag .jars to your project's libs/ folder).
